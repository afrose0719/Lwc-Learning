    <!-- Component Lifecycle Hooks
    A lifecycle hook is a callback method triggered at a specific phase of a component instance lifecycle.

    Mounting phase
    constructor()       connectedCallback()     render() renderedCallback()

    Unmounting phase
    disconnectedCallback()

    Error Phase
    errorCallback()

    render()
    Technically render() its not lifecycle hook. it's a protected method on the lightning elements class.

    Lifecycle Hooks in Mounting phase
        constructor()
        connectedCallback()
        renderedCallback()
   
        Constructor() Method
        
        Point to remember
        This hook is invoked, when a component instance is created.
        you have to call super() first inside this
        At this point, the component properties won't be ready yes.
        To access the host element, use this.template
        This method lifecycle flows from parent to child compnent.
        we can't access child elements in the component body because they dont exist yet.
        Don't add attributes to the host element in the constructor.   -->

        <!-- connectedCallback Method
        points to remember
        
        Called when the element is inserted into a document.
        this hook flows from parent to child
        you can't access child elements in the component body because they dont exist yet
        you can access the host element with this.template.
        use it to: perform initialization tasks, such as fetch data, set up caches, or listen for events (such as publish-subscribe events)
        do not use: connectedCallback() to change the state of a component, such as loading values or setting properties, use getters and setters instead  -->

        <!-- renderedCallback Method
        
        Points to remember
        Fires when a component rendering is done.
        It can fire more than once.
        This hook flow from chilt to parent.
        when a component re-renders. all the expressions used in the template are reevaluated.

        Do not use renderedCallback()
       1. to change the state or update property of component
       2. Don't update a wire adapter configuration object property in renderedCallback(), as it can result in an infinite loop. -->

            <!-- disconnectedCallback Method
            Fires when a component is removed from the DOM
            it flows from parent to child
            this callback method is specific to lightning web components, it isnt from the HTML custom element specification. -->
         
         <!-- errorCallback(err,stack) Method
         
         points to remember
        this method called when a descendant component throws an error in one of its callback
        the error argument is a javascript native error object, and the stack argument is a string.
        this callback method is specific to lightning web component, it isnot from the HTML custom
        element specification -->

    <!-- Render Method
    Render is a method that tells the component which template to load based on
    some condition, it always return the template reference.

    Points to remember
    the render() method is not technically a lifecycle hook. it is a protected method on the
    LightningElement class.
    Call this method to update the UI. it May be called before or after connectedCallback()
    it's rare to call render() in a component. The main use case is to conditionally render a template. -->

    <!-- When to prefere multiple template over if:true/if:false
    if:true/if:false is recommended whenever there is small template to hide and show
    Ideally it's always recommend to break down your component into smallest unit.
    whenever we have a scenario in which we have same business logic but we want to render
    a component with more than one look and feel.
    whenever we have two design in same component but not want to mix the HTML in one file. -->
